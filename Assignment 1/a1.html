<h2>Reflection and Insights

    Joomla is not the most user friendly when it comes to beginner level interactions. Even on an intermediate level
    they are multiple issues faced by many as pointed out on forums. Dealing with free versions of plugins is also quite
    challenging as these intentionally limit how much you can edit the site. Having to find a
    suitable host and domain name for free was also quite challenging. Most

<p>Describe your experience creating sites using the two different CMSs.

    Using two CMS allows you to gain perspective on the inner workings of each. From using Wordpress and Joomla, I have
    realised Wordpress is more user-friendly and offers a better experience for someone who is new to utilizing CMS for
    website creation. Wordpress also offers more options for free software.

    Despite Joomla being touted as the more secure of the two, even those with considerable experience in CMS still
    experience difficulties utilizing this CMS. The free versions of plugins and extensions offered face issues. I
    experienced some timing out problems with Joomla.

    Overall I prefer Wordpress.
